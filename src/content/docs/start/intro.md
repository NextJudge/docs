⚡️ Welcome to the documentation for NextJudge! ⚡️

We're an OSU senior capstone software engineering project aiming to create an open-source, extensible, and modular competitive programming code execution and judging framework.

## What is NextJudge?

At its core, NextJudge is a code execution and judging framework. It allows you to host competitive programming contests and judge submissions. We found that there are a number of platforms that allow you to host competitive programming contests, but none of them are open-source, extensible, and modular. We decided to create NextJudge to fill this gap.

## Why was NextJudge created?

We created NextJudge to not only fill the existing gap in the market, but also to provide a way for our student ACM chapter to host our own competitive programming contests. This allows us to have more control over the platform and allows us to customize it to suit our needs.

## Who is NextJudge for?

NextJudge is for anyone who wants to host competitive programming contests. Be it a student ACM chapter, a company, or an individual, NextJudge is for you. The goal isn't necessarily to replace existing platforms, but to provide an alternative that is open-source, extensible, and modular.
